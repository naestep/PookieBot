# Simple Explosions Physics Simulation

A fun interactive physics simulation where you can create explosions that affect a ball in a box.

## Features

- Ball with realistic gravity and physics
- Click anywhere to create explosions
- Explosions push the ball away
- The closer to the ball you click, the stronger the explosion force
- Realistic collision with walls and bouncing

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## How to Play

1. The blue ball will start falling due to gravity
2. Click anywhere in the box to create an explosion
3. The explosion will push the ball away from the click point
4. The closer you click to the ball, the stronger the force

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Physics Implementation

The simulation implements:
- Gravity
- Friction
- Bounce physics
- Explosion forces
- Wall collisions

Enjoy playing with the physics simulation!
